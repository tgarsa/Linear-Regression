# Linear-Regression
In this project, I will build linear regression models using different aproches.

## Data

The data, that I will use to train the models, are located in the data folder. We will have some categorical and a 
numerical data set, and we train different models using both datasets.
The set of files are:

* linear_numeric.csv
* linear_numeric_summarized.csv
* linear_numeric_dummies.csv

### linear_numeric.csv

In this case the target is a numerical feature with values in the interval from 0 to 5;
And the inputs features are numerical too. 

The inputs features have values between 1 and 5, the G1 and G2 only between 1 and 4. 

### linear_numeric_summarized.csv

### linear_numeric_dummies.csv

## Notebooks

I defined a different model in each notebook; the idea is to compare how to define the possible models and the 
results. The idea is to look at how close the models are between them. 

The approaches that I used are:

* [Numerical](Numerical/ReadMe.md)
* Sssssss
* ]SSSSS
